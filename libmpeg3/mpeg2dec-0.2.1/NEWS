mpeg2dec-0.2.1 Sun Mar 17 23:24:04 PST 2002 

Two major new features: First, a much higher tolerance to corrupted
streams. Instead of just segfaulting, we should now be able to keep
going after errors. There is no test suite for this feature yet though.

Second, the altivec optimizations provide a huge speedup (more than
2.5x) on ppc g4 machines.

High definition video streams are now supported.

There is also native support for compiling using VC++.

And, the libvo interface has been slightly extended so people can more
easily make use of the various mpeg flags.


mpeg2dec-0.2.0 Thu Feb 15 20:12:34 PST 2001 

The most important new feature is the support for field
pictures. mpeg2dec is now able to display any conformant
"main profile @ main level" mpeg-2 stream. This means any
stream you should actually encounter in practice :)

We also added some more accelerations for motion compensation and
color conversion - 3Dnow and SSE. Non-x86 accelerations would be
welcome - patches anyone ?

libmpeg2 and libvo are now fully reentrant. This will enable other
projects to reuse the mpeg2dec codebase without patches. For the same
reason we added support for "make install"

Libvo has been switched to a new API. The immediate advantage is that
it allowed us to get rid of the "HACK_MODE" setting - you really dont
want to know. In the future this will also help a lot with the
implementation of synchro.

Portability enhancements - including support for win32 DLLs. This was
done to get into the hearts of a few more developpers :)


mpeg2dec-0.1.7 Thu Nov  2 21:38:33 PST 2000

First release since march ! Lots of new features : improved
performance, mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 support, integrated demuxer, standards
compliance.

The major missing feature is mpeg-2 field pictures, this is planned
for mpeg2dec-0.2.0
