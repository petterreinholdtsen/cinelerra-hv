BIG BUGS
----------------
Node framerates not displaying.
Drag effect before timeline is finished drawing after a load -> lockup
Load a sound file.  Change the file on the disk.  Crash on exit.
Change asset path, CPlayback never returns to redraw the frame.
Starting recording sometimes jumps to end of time duration or
significantly ahead and stops.






WISH LIST
----------------

Private plugin data storage in the track.
 - save_private(position) & load_private(position) calls
 - the problem is the playback thread doesn't have access to the timeline EDL
 - would need a call to send data back to the timeline EDL
Double click -> select edit -> drag to expand selection by edit
Embedded sequences
Remove unused files from project and disk.

Digital TV
 - dump network tuner
 - combined tuner driver for audio and video
 - channel scan only detects physical number and pids default to 0
 - user adds channels based on physical number
 - dialog adds new subchannels as they're detected
 - user selects PID's for audio and video in the channel edit dialog
 - filters PID's because of image format differences
 - software preview of video and audio.  
 - Maybe audio decoded in the record driver with playback on the playback device.
