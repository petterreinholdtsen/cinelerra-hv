- added mpeg demux (mpeg 1 and 2 compatible).
- added ASF demux.
- added prototype RM demux.
- added AC3 decoding (done with libac3 by Aaron Holtzman).
- added decoding codec parameter guessing (.e.g. for mpeg, because the
  header does not include them).
- fixed header generation in mpeg1, AVI and ASF mux : wmplayer can now
  play them (only tested video).
- fixed h263 white bug.
- fixed phase rounding in img resample filter.
- add mmx code for polyphase img resample filter.

  decoder).
- added fractional frame rate support.
- codecs are no longer searched by read_header() (should fix ffserver
  segfault).

version 0.4.3:

- BGR24 patch (initial patch by Jeroen Vreeken <pe1rxq@amsat.org>).

this +codec ;) (JuanJo).

- added pgm and .Y.U.V output format.
- suppressed 'img:' protocol. Simply use: /tmp/test%d.[pgm|Y] as input or
  output.

  <lists@reserv.at>, but changed completely since we use a format
  instead of a protocol).

version 0.4.2:

- added H263/MPEG4/MSMPEG4 decoding support. MPEG4 decoding support
  (for openDIVX) is almost complete: 8x8 MVs and rounding are
  missing. MSMPEG4 support is complete.
- added prototype MPEG1 decoder. Only I and P frames handled yet (it
  can decode ffmpeg mpegs :-)).
- added libavcodec API documentation (see apiexample.c).
- fixed image polyphase bug (the bottom of some images could be
  greenish).
- added support for non clipped motion vectors (decoding only)
  and image sizes non multiple of 16.

version 0.4.1:

- added MSMPEG4 (aka DIVX) compatible encoder. Changed default codec
  of avi and asf to DIV3.
- added -me option to set motion estimation method
  (default=log). suppressed redundant -hq option.
- added options -acodec and -vcodec to force a given codec (useful for
  AVI for example).
- fixed -an option.
- improved dct_quantize speed.
- factorized some motion estimation code.

- removing grab code from ffserver and moved it to ffmpeg. Added multi
  stream support to ffmpeg.
- added timeshifting support for live feeds (option ?date=xxx in the
  URL).
- added high quality image resize code with polyphase filter (need
  mmx/see optimisation). Enable multiple image size support in ffserver.
- added multi live feed support in ffserver.
- suppressed master feature from ffserver (it should be done with an
  external program which opens the .ffm url and writes it to another
  ffserver).
- added preliminary support for video stream parsing (wav and avi half
  done). Added proper support for audio/video file convertion in
  ffmpeg.
- added preliminary support for video file sending from ffserver.
- redesigning I/O subsystem : now using URL based input and output
  (see avio.h).
- added wav format support.
- added "tty user interface" to ffmpeg to stop grabbing gracefully.
- added MMX/SSE optimizations to SAD (Sums of Absolutes Diferences)
  (Juan J. Sierralta P. a.k.a. "Juanjo" <juanjo@atmlab.utfsm.cl>).
- added MMX DCT from mpeg2_movie 1.5 (Juanjo).

- changed directories : libav for format handling, libavcodec for
  codecs.

- added stereo in mpeg audio encoder.

version 0.3.3:

- added 'high quality' mode which use motion vectors. It can be used in
  real time at low resolution.

  bitrates and large gop size.

version 0.3.2: small fixes

- asf fixes
- put_seek bug fix

version 0.3.1: added avi/divx support
