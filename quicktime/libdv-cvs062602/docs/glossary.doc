 \page glossary Glossary

 \c libdv source code makes frequent reference to the following
    terminology, most of which comes from the DV
    standards documents, especially the SMPTE version.  

 <dl>
    <dt><a name="glossary-dif">DIF</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Digital Interface.  DV standard specific terminology, referring
      to the digital data format of <a name="glossary-dvc">DVC</a>
      tapes.
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="glossary-dif-block">DIF blocks</a></dt>
    <dd>
      A block of 80 bytes.  This is the basic data framing unit of the
      <a href="#glossary-dvc">DVC</a> tape format, analogous to
      sectors of hard disc.  
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="glossary-dvc">DVC</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Digital Video Cassette, refers to the family of tape formats for
      DV video that differ in their physical design, but share the
      same digital format for data.  Examples are
      <strong>miniDV</strong>, <strong>dvCAM</strong>, etc.
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="glossary-video-segment">Video Segment</a></dt>
    <dd>
      A video segment consists of 5 <a href="#glossary-dif-block>DIF
      blocks</a>, each corresponding to a single compressed
      macroblock, assembled from various areas within the video frame.
      DV format requires a 3 pass parsing algorithm for compressed
      macroblocks, where data is spilled between blocks of a
      macroblock, and then macroblocks of a video segment.  Because
      the macroblocks in a video segment are shuffled from various
      areas of the video frame, more visually complex areas of the
      frame may be able to spill their data into space for less
      visually complex areas of the frame.  This helps the encoder map
      the variable rate requirements of the video to the constant rate
      data layout of the format.
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="glossary-video-section">Video Section</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Each DIF sequence contains a video section, consisting of 135 <a
      href="#glossary-dif-block">DIF blocks</a>, which are further
      subdivided into <a href="#glossary-video-segment>Video
      Segments</a>.
