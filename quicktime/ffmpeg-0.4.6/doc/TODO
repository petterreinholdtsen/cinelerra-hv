ffmpeg TODO list:
----------------

Fabrice's TODO list: (in approximate decreasing priority order)
-------------------
- add av_log() in libavcodec and suppress all printf
- commit new imgconvert API and new PIX_FMT_xxx alpha formats
- new ffplay based on qemacs x11/fb/vt100 GUI.
- commit av_read_frame() API and associated support in libavcodec:
  ffserver will be able to stream MPEG and MPEG4 files in
  RTSP/RTP/SDP.
- add new float/integer audio filterting and conversion
- commit new LGPL'ed float and integer-only AC3 decoder
- add WMA integer-only decoder
- integrate custom Vorbis Tremor based integer and float decoder
- add new MPEG4-AAC audio decoder (both integer-only and float version)
- fix telecine and frame rate conversion

Michael's TODO list: (unordered) (if anyone wanna help with sth, just ask)
-------------------
- finish implementation of WMV2 j-picture
- H264 codec (after its a standart or at least more stable)
- slower / better zonal ME
- better & cleaner b frame ME
- per MB ratecontrol (so VCD and such do work better)
- more optimizations
- more compare functions for ME
- simper rate control
- qpel encoding
- split h263.c
- mpeg2 encoding (after the ME impovements)
- mpeg1 b frames (after the ME impovements)

Francois' TODO list: (unordered, without any timeframe)
-------------------
- test MACE decoder against the openquicktime one as suggested by A'rpi
- mov/mp4 muxer
- BeOS audio input grabbing backend
- BeOS video input grabbing backend
- have a REAL BeOS errno fix (return MKERROR(EXXX);), not a hack
- publish my BeOS libposix on BeBits so I can officially support ffserver :)
- check the whole code for thread-safety (global and init stuff)

Philip'a TODO list: (alphabetically ordered) (please help)
------------------
- Add a multi-ffm filetype so that feeds can be recorded into multiple files rather
  than one big file. 
- Authenticated users support -- where the authentication is in the URL
- Change ASF files so that the embedded timestamp in the frames is right rather
  than being an offset from the start of the stream
- Make ffm files more resilient to changes in the codec structures so that you
  can play old ffm files.
