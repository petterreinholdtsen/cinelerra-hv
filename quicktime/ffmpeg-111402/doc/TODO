ffmpeg TODO list:
----------------

(in approximate decreasing priority order)

Short term fixes:
- AV sync fix
- put ffserver patches
- reconstruct mpeg header frame rate in telecine case so that we do
  not need to infer the real rate if it is not possible.
- RTP/RTSP streaming support in ffserver and in libav
- minimal support of video in ffplay

Planned in next releases:

- remove unused DCT code.
- fix stream selection (aka map) syntax. Start stream numbers at 1 in
  listing. Find a syntax for stream ids (such as TS pids).
- add DV codec/format support
- fix bugs when stream begins with a P/B frame 
- add qscale out.
- fix -sameq in grabbing
- add vivo format support (may need long term prediction support)
- add raw h263 decoding support
- add qscale out.
- find a solution to clear feed1.ffm if format change.
- fix 0 size picture in AVIs = skip picture
- rewrite huffyuv (http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~benrg/huffyuv.html)

BUGS:

- fix audio/video synchro (including real player synchro bugs)

- Improve the bit rate control for video codecs (done).

- see ov511.o YUV problem (420 instead of 420P) (done?).

- fix file caching pb in windows (add correct headers)

- add low pass filter to suppress noise coming from cheap TV cards.

- test/debug audio in flash format

- sort out ASF streaming pbs (partially done)

- Improve psycho acoustic model for AC3 & mpeg audio.

FEATURES:

- add h263 PB frame support (some I263 files use that).

- add MPEG4 in mpegmux support.

- demux streams for CCTV : N streams in one stream. Add option to
  generate multiple streams.

- add disconnect user option in stat.html.

- deny & allow + password in ffserver.
