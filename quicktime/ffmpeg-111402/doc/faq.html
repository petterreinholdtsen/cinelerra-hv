FFmpeg FAQ

<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="faq.html#TOC2">1.1 ffserver doesn't not work.</A></H2>

<P>
ffmpeg development is now concentrated on the codec and format
handling. New developments broke ffserver, so don't expect it to work
correctly. It is planned to fix it ASAP.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="faq.html#TOC3">1.2 I cannot read this file although this format seems to be suppored by ffmpeg.</A></H2>

<P>
Even if ffmpeg can read the file format, it may not support all its
codecs. Please consult the supported codec list in the ffmpeg
documentation.




<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="faq.html#TOC4">1.3 I get audio/video synchro problems when grabbing.</A></H2>

<P>
Currently, the grabbing stuff does not handle synchronisation
correctly. You are free to correct it. It is planned to fix it ASAP.




<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="faq.html#TOC5">1.4 How do I encode jpegs to another format ?</A></H2>

<P>
If the jpegs are named img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg,..., use:



<PRE>
  ffmpeg -i img%d.jpg /tmp/a.mpg
</PRE>

<P>
<SAMP>`%d'</SAMP> is replaced by the image number.


<P>
<TT>`img%03d.jpg'</TT> generates <TT>`img001.jpg'</TT>, <TT>`img002.jpg'</TT>, etc...


<P>
The same system is used for the other image formats.




<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="faq.html#TOC6">1.5 FFmpeg does not support codec XXX. Can you include a Windows DLL loader to support it ?</A></H2>

<P>
No. FFmpeg only supports open source codecs. Windows DLLs are not
portable, bloated and often slow.




<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="faq.html#TOC7">2. Development</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="faq.html#TOC8">2.1 Can you support my C compiler XXX ?</A></H2>

<P>
No. Only GCC is supported. GCC is ported on most systems available and I
don't see the need to pollute the source code with <CODE>#ifdef</CODE>s
related to the compiler.




<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="faq.html#TOC9">2.2 I want to use ffmpeg or libavcodec under Windows. Can you support my proprietary C compiler XXX ?</A></H2>

<P>
No. Use <CODE>mingw-gcc</CODE> available at <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</A> to
compile the code. It generates object files fully compatible with other
windows compilers.




<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="faq.html#TOC10">2.3 Can you add automake, libtool or autoconf support ?</A></H2>

<P>
No. These tools are too blowted and they complicate the build. Moreover,
since only <SAMP>`gcc'</SAMP> is supported they would add little advantages in
terms of portability.
