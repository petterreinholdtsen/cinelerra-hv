<h1>ABOUT CINELERRA</h1>

<p>There are two types of moviegoers: producers who create new content,
going back over their content at future points for further refinement,
and consumers who want to acquire the content and watch it.  Cinelerra
is not intended for consumers.  Cinelerra has many features for
uncompressed content, high resolution processing, and compositing, with
very few shortcuts.  Producers need these features because of the need
to retouch many generations of footage with alterations to the format,
which makes Cinelerra very complex. There are many more standard tools
for consumers like MainActor, Kino, or Moxy, which you should consider
before using Cinelerra.

<p>In 1996 our first editor came out: Broadcast 1.0.  It was just a window
with a waveform in it, it could cut and paste stereo audio waveforms on
a UNIX box, except unlike other audio editors it could handle files up
to 2 gigabytes with only 64 megs of RAM.  That was a feature normally
only accessible to the highest end professional audio houses.

<p>In 1997 Broadcast 1.0 was replaced by Broadcast 2.0.  This time the
window had a menubar, patchbay, console, and transport control. 
Broadcast 2.0 still only handled audio but this time it handled
unlimited tracks, and it could perform effects on audio and save the
resulting waveform to disk.  More notably a few effects could be
performed as the audio was playing back, in realtime.  A user could mix
unlimited numbers of tracks, adjust fade, pan, and EQ, and hear the
result instantly.   Amazingly this real time tweeking is still
unavailable on most audio programs.

<p>But Broadcast 2.0 still didn't handle video and it wasn't very graceful
at audio either.  In 1999 video broke into the story with Broadcast
2000.  This iteration of the Broadcast series could do wonders with
audio and offered a pretty good video feature set.  It could edit video
files up to 64 terabytes.  It could do everything Broadcast 2.1 did
with audio except now all effects for video and audio could be chained
and performed on the fly, with instant feedback as a user tweeked
parameters during playback.  Broadcast 2000 made it very easy to do a
lot of processing and editing on video and audio that would otherwise
involve many hours setting up command line sequences and writing to
disk. For a time it seemed as if the original dream of immersive movie
making for everyone regardless of income level had arrived.

<p>Later on Broadcast 2000 began to come short.  Its audio was pretty
graceful.  Its video was graceful if you knew how to use it
efficiently, but quality issues and new user interface techniques were
emerging.  Broadcast 2000 kept the audio interface from its ancestors,
which didn't apply well to video.  Users likewise were maturing.  No
longer would it be sufficient to just edit video on a UNIX box.  Most
users expected on UNIX the same thing they got in Win or Mac. In mid
2000 designs for a Broadcast 2000 replacement were drafted.  The
Broadcast name was officially retired from the series and the software
would now be called Cinelerra.  Cinelerra would allow users to
configure certain effects in much less time than required with
Broadcast 2000.  It would begin to emulate some of the features found
in Win and Mac software while not attempting to become a clone.  It's
interface would be designed for video from the ground up, while
supplementing that with the Broadcast audio interface.  As always,
quality improvements would happen.

<h2>ABOUT THIS MANUAL</h2>

<p>After many years of searching for the perfect documentation format
we've arrived at TexInfo.  This format can be converted to HTML,
printed, automatically indexed, but most importantly is not bound to
any commercial word processor.  Documents written in Texinfo will be
readable as long as there's a C compiler.

<p>There are no screenshots in this manual.  Screenshots become obsolete
quickly and as a result confuse the users.  What looks one way in a
screenshot will always look different in the real program because the
real program and the manual are always evolving, never perfectly
synchronized.  It is true that manuals should have screenshots, but our
objective in omitting screenshots is to keep the software costs minimal
so you don't have to pay for it.  That includes additional labor to
synchronize the manual with the software.

<p>In addition to telling you the basic editing features of Cinelerra this
manual covers tricks that won't be described anywhere else.  We're
going to try to come up with certain things you can do with Cinelerra
that you wouldn't think of on your own.

<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>

<p>The Cinelerra package contains Cinelerra, Mix2000, Mplex, and XMovie,
along with standalone libraries for various functions.  All these
programs are useful and in most cases they're the only free programs
available for dealing with uncompressed, high resolution movies.

<p>All of these programs tie into the same code base.  Updates in one area
of the code base usually affect everything else so everything would
have to be downloaded again even if one thing changed.  By including
everything in one package you can be instantly updated for movie making
after one download.

<p>The purpose of the various programs is as follows:

<ul>

<li>
Cinelerra - capturing, editing and production of material

<li>
Mix2000 - higher resolution volume controller than the standard Linux
volume controls.

<li>
MPlex - Multiplexing of MPEG elementary streams.

<li>
XMovie - Standalone player for all the formats Cinelerra exports.

<li>
mpeg3toc - Utility for indexing and reading MPEG files.

</ul>

<p>We try to include all the dependancies because of the difficulty in
tracking them down.  Furthermore, the versions of some of the
dependancies Cinelerra requires differ from the versions other
utilities may require, making it impossible to coexist on the same
system without static inclusion.

<p>Cinelerra is best installed by downloading an RPM and running

<pre>rpm -U --force --nodeps hvirtual*.rpm
</pre>

<p>on a RedHat system.

<p>On systems which don't support RPM look for a utility called
<em>rpm2cpio</em>.  Download a Cinelerra RPM and from the /
directory run

<pre>rpm2cpio hvirtual*.rpm | cpio -i --make-directories
</pre>

<p>It should be noted that the compiler used in building Cinelerra
binaries is the free GNU compiler and although it can reorder
instructions for Pentium I and use some the of Pentium II branch
instructions it's 12 years behind most modern CPUs.  You can try
different compilers and optimization flags by compiling the source.

<p>Compiling the source is hard and there's no warranty if the source code
fails to compile, but the method for compiling starts by downloading
the source code and decompressing.

<pre>tar jxf hvirtual*.tar.bz2
</pre>

<p>Enter the hvirtual directory

<pre>cd hvirtual
</pre>

<p>and set some environment variables.  For Pentium II use:

<pre>export CFLAGS='-O3 -march=i686 -fmessage-length=0 -funroll-all-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -I/usr/local/include'
</pre>

<p>For Pentium I and old AMD's use:

<pre>export CFLAGS='-O3 -fmessage-length=0 -funroll-all-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -I/usr/local/include'
</pre>

<p>Then run

<pre>make
</pre>

<p>The make procedure should run through all the directories and put
binaries in the <em>i686</em> directories.  When we originally supported
Alpha it was convenient to compile Alpha and i686 binaries
simultaneously, in different directories so all the binaries are put in
i686 directories.

<p>Once finished run

<pre>make install
</pre>

<p>to install the binaries.  The output is put in the following directories:

<ul>
<li>Executables -&gt;/usr/bin
<li>Plugins  -&gt;/usr/lib/cinelerra
</ul>

<p>The main binaries are the Cinelerra, XMovie, Mix2000 executables and
several utilities for reading MPEG transport streams.

<p>Run Cinelerra by running

<pre>/usr/bin/cinelerra
</pre>

<h1>CONFIGURATION</h1>

<p>Because of the variety of uses, Cinelerra cannot be run optimally
without some intimate configuration for your specific needs. Very few
parameters are adjustible at compile time.  Runtime configuration is
the only option for most configuration because of the multitude of
parameters.

<p>Go to <em>settings-&gt;preferences</em> and run through the options.

<h3>AUDIO OUT</h3>

<p>These determine what happens when you play sound from the timeline.

<ul>

<li>SAMPLES TO READ FROM DISK

<p>Cinelerra uses a pipeline for rendering audio. The first stage is
reading large chunks of audio from disk, the samples to read from
disk.  This is followed by processing small fragments in a virtual
console.

</p><li>SAMPLES TO SEND TO CONSOLE:

<p>The second stage is rendering small fragments through the virtual
console to the sound driver. A larger value here causes more latency
when you change mixing parameters but gives more reliable playback.

<p>Some sound drivers don't allow changing of the console fragment so
latency is unchanged no matter what this value is.

</p><li>
VIEW FOLLOWS PLAYBACK

<p>Causes the timeline window to scroll when the playback cursor moves out
of view.  This can bog down the X Server.

</p><li>USE SOFTWARE FOR POSITIONING INFORMATION

<p>Most soundcards and sound drivers don't give reliable information on
the number of samples the card has played. When playing video you need
this information for synchronization. This option causes the sound
driver to be ignored and a software timer to be used for
synchronization.

</p><li>AUDIO PLAYBACK IN REALTIME:

<p>Back in the days when 150Mhz was the maximum, this allowed
uninterrupted playback on heavy loads. Now you'll probably only need it
for playing video and audio when the load is to high for uninterrupted
audio.

</p><li>AUDIO DRIVER

<p>There are many sound drivers for Linux.  This allows selecting one and
setting parameters specific to it.  Some of the common parameters for a
sound driver are

<ul>

<li>DEVICE PATH

<p>Usually a file in the <em>/dev/</em> directory which controls the
device.

</p><li>
BITS

<p>The number of bits of precision Cinelerra should set the device for. 
This sometimes has a figuritive meaning.  Some sound drivers need to be
set to 32 bits to perform 24 bit playback and won't play anything when
set to 24 bits.  Some sound drivers need to be set to 24 bits for 24
bit playback.

</p><li>
CHANNELS

<p>The number of channels Cinelerra should set the device for.  Regardless
of the number of channels in the project, the number of channels set
here will be written to the device.  When this is set to 2 and the
project has 1 channel you'll hear sound through the left speaker and
not centered as expected for a monaural project.  When this is set to 1
and the project has 2 channels you'll hear the left channel centered
and not 2 channels mixed together.

</ul>

<h3>VIDEO OUT</h3>

<p>These determine what happens when you play video from the timeline.

<ul>

<li>
FRAMERATE ACHIEVED

<p>The number of frames per second being
displayed during playback.

</p><li>
SCALING EQUATION

<p>The algorithm used in all video resizing in
the virtual console.  This doesn't affect scaling to the size of the
compositor window.

<ul>

<li>NEAREST NEIGHBOR ENLARGE AND REDUCE

<p>lowest but fastest
quality.  Produces jagged edges and uneven motion.

</p><li>
BICUBIC ENLARGE AND BILINEAR REDUCE

<p>highest but slowest
quality.  For enlarging a bicubic interpolation is used, which blurs
slightly but doesn't reveal stair steps.  For reduction a bilinear
interpolation is used, which produces very sharp images and reduces
noise.  The bilinear reduced images can be sharpened with a sharpen
effect with less noise than a normal sized image.

</p><li>
BILINEAR ENLARGE AND BILINEAR REDUCE

<p>when slight enlargement
is needed a bilinear enlargement looks better than a bicubic
enlargement.

</ul>

</p><li>
PRELOAD BUFFER FOR QUICKTIME

<p>The Quicktime/AVI decoder can
handle CDROM sources better when this is around 1000000.  This reduces
the amount of seeking.  For normal use this should be 0.

</p><li>
VIDEO DRIVER

<p>Normally video on the timeline goes to the
compositor window during continuous playback and when the insertion
point is repositioned.  Instead of sending video to the Compositor
window the video driver can be set to send video to another output
device during continuous playback.  This doesn't affect where video
goes when the insertion point is repositioned, however.

<p>Various parameters are given for Video Driver depending on the driver.

<ul>

<li>
DISPLAY

<p>The is intended for dual monitor
displays.  Depending on the value of Display, the Compositor window
will appear on a different monitor from the rest of the windows.

</p><li>
DEVICE PATH

<p>Usually a file in the <em>/dev/</em> directory
which controls the device.

</p><li>
SWAP FIELDS

<p>Make the even lines odd and the odd lines even
when sending to the device.  On an NTSC or 1080i monitor the fields may
need to be swapped to prevent jittery motion.

</p><li>
OUTPUT CHANNEL

<p>Devices with multiple outputs may need a
specific connector to send video on.

</p><li>
PORT

<p>The IEEE1394 standard specifies something known as the
<em>port</em>.  This is probably the firewire card number in the system
to use.

</p><li>
CHANNEL

<p>The IEEE1394 standard specifies something known as the
<em>channel</em>.  For DV cameras it's always <em>63</em>.

<h3>AUDIO IN</h3>

<p>These determine what happens when you record audio.

<ul>
<li>
RECORD DRIVER

<p>This is used for recording audio in the Record window.  It may be
shared with the Record Driver for video if the audio and video are
wrapped in the same stream.  It takes variable parameters depending on
the driver.  The parameters have the same meaning as they do for
playback.

<ul>
<li>
DEVICE PATH

<p>Usually a file in the <em>/dev/</em> directory which controls the
device.

</p><li>
BITS

<p>The number of bits of precision Cinelerra should set the device for. 
This sometimes has a figuritive meaning.  Some sound drivers need to be
set to 32 bits to perform 24 bit recording and won't record anything
when set to 24 bits.  Some sound drivers need to be set to 24 bits for
24 bit recording.

</p><li>CHANNELS

<p>The number of channels Cinelerra should set the device for.  Regardless
of the number of channels in the record operation, the number of
channels set here will be read from the device.  When this is set to 2
and the record operation has 1 channel you'll record the left speaker
and not a mix of the left and right speakers as expected for a monaural
project.  When this is set to 1 and the project has 2 channels you'll
record the left and right channels mixed into the left speaker and not
1 channel spead across two speakers.

</ul>

</p><li>
SAMPLES TO WRITE AT A TIME

<p>Audio is first read in small fragments from the device.  Many small
fragments are combined into a large fragment before writing to disk. 
The disk writing process is done in a different thread.  The value here
determines how large the combination of fragments is for each disk
write.

</p><li>
SAMPLE RATE FOR RECORDING

<p>Regardless of what the project settings are.  This is the sample rate
used for recording.  This should be the highest the audio device
supports.

</ul>

<h3>VIDEO IN</h3>

<p>These determine what happens when you record video.

<ul>
<li>
RECORD DRIVER

<p>This is used for recording video in the Record window.  It may be
shared with the Record Driver for audio if the audio and video are
wrapped in the same stream.  It takes variable parameters depending on
the driver.  The parameters have the same meaning as they do for
playback.

</p><li>
FRAMES TO RECORD TO DISK AT A TIME

<p>Frames are recorded in a pipeline.  First frames are buffered in the
device.  Then they're read into a larger buffer for writing to disk. 
The disk writing is done in a different thread as the device reading. 
For certain codecs the disk writing uses multiple processors.  This
value determines how many frames are written to disk at a time.

</p><li>
FRAMES TO BUFFER IN DEVICE

<p>The number of frames to store in the device before reading.  This
determines how much latency there can be in the system before frames
are dropped.

</p><li>USE SOFTWARE FOR POSITIONING INFORMATION

<p>Video uses audio for

<p>synchronization but most soundcards don't give accurate position
information.  This calculates an estimation of audio position in
software instead of the hardware for synchronization.

</p><li>
SYNC DRIVES AUTOMATICALLY

<p>For high bitrate recording the drives may be fast enough to store the
data but Linux may wait several minutes and stall as it writes several
minutes of data at a time.  This forces Linux to flush its buffers
every second instead of every few minutes and produce slightly better
realtime behavior.

</p><li>
SIZE OF CAPTURED FRAME

<p>This is the size of the frames recorded.  It is independant of the
project frame size because most video devices only record a fixed frame
size.  If the frame size given here isn't supported by the device it
might crash Cinelerra.

</p><li>FRAME RATE FOR RECORDING

<p>The frame rate recorded is different from the project settings.  This
sets the recorded frame rate.

<h2>PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p>You'll spend most of your time configuring this section.

<ul>
<li><a href="#RENDERFARM">RENDERFARM</a>: 
</ul>

<ul>

<li>
INDEX FILES GO HERE

<p>Back in the days when 4 MB/sec was unearthly speed for a hard drive,
index files were introduced to speed up drawing the audio tracks.  This
option determines where index files are placed on the hard drive.

</p><li>
SIZE OF INDEX FILE

<p>Determines the size of an index file. Larger index sizes allow smaller
files to be drawn faster while slowing down the drawing of large files. 
Smaller index sizes allow large files to be drawn faster while slowing
down small files.

</p><li>
NUMBER OF INDEX FILES TO KEEP

<p>To keep the index directory from becoming unruly, old index files are
deleted. This determines the maximum number of index files to keep in
the directory.

</p><li>
DELETE ALL INDEXES

<p>When you change the index size or you want to clean out excessive index
files, this deletes all the index files.

</p><li>CACHE ITEMS

<p>To speed up rendering, several assets are kept open simultaneously. 
This determines how many are kept open.  A number too large may exhaust
your memory pretty fast and result in a crash.  A number too small may
result in slow playback as assets need to be reopened more frequently.

</p><li>
SECONDS TO PREROLL RENDERS

<p>Some effects need a certain amount of time to settle in.  This sets a
number of seconds to render without writing to disk before the selected
region is rendered.  When using the renderfarm you'll sometimes need to
preroll to get seemless transitions between the jobs.  Every job in a
renderfarm is prerolled by this value.

</p><li>
FORCE SINGLE PROCESSOR USE

<p>Cinelerra tries to use all processors on the system by default but
sometimes you'll only want to use one processor, like in a renderfarm
client.  This forces only one processer to be used.  The operating
system, however, usually uses the second processor anyway for disk
access so this option is really a 1.25 processor mode. </ul>

<em>HOSTNAME</em> and <em>PORT</em>.  The changes won't be committed if you
don't hit this buttoin.

</p><li>
ADD NODE

<p>Create a new node with the <em>HOSTNAME</em> and <em>PORT</em> settings.

</p><li>
DELETE NODE

<p>Deletes whatever node is highlighted in the <em>NODES</em> list.

</p><li>
SORT NODES

<p>Sorts the <em>NODES</em> list based on the hostname.

</p><li>
FILESYSTEM PREFIX ON REMOTE NODES

<p>Sets the relative location of all the assets on the nodes.  If the
assets are in <em>/mov</em> on the master and the master filesystem is
mounted under <em>/mnt</em> on the nodes, the filesystem prefix should be
<em>/mnt</em>.  Ideally the assets should appear under the same directory
on the nodes as the master.  In this case the filesystem prefix can be
<em>/</em>.

</p><li>
TOTAL JOBS TO CREATE

<p>Determines the number of jobs to dispatch to the renderfarm.  The more
jobs you create, the more finely balanced the renderfarm becomes.

<h2>INTERFACE</h2>

<p>These parameters affect purely how the user interface works.

<ul>

<li>USE HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS.XXX

<p>Various representations of time are given.  Select the most convenient
one.  The time representation can also be changed by <em>CTRL</em>
clicking on the time ruler.

</p><li>USE THUMBNAILS

<p>The Resource Window displays thumbnails of assets by default.  This can
take a long time to set up.  This option disables the thumbnails.

</p><li>CLICKING IN/OUT POINTS DOES WHAT

<p>Cinelerra not only allows you to perform editing by dragging in/out
points but also defines three seperate operations which occur when you
drag an in/out point. For each mouse button you select the behavior in
this window. The usage of each editing mode is described in editing.

</p><li>MIN DB FOR METER

<p>Some sound sources have a lower noise threshold than others. 
Everything below the noise threshold is meaningless.  This option sets
the meters to clip below a certain level.  Consumer soundcards usually
bottom out at -65.  Professional soundcards bottom out at -90.

</p><li>FORMAT FOR METER

<p>This option allows you to select the format for all the VU meters. If
you're a CS major select percentage and if you're a EE major select DB. 
With that, be aware all levels in Cinelerra are input as DB.

</p><li>THEME

<p>Cinelerra supports variable themes.  Select one here and restart
Cinelerra to see it.

<h1>THE MAIN WINDOWS</h1>

<p>When Cinelerra first starts, you'll get four main windows.  Hitting
<em>CTRL-w</em> in any window closes it.

<ul>

<li>Viewer

<p>In here you'll scrub around source media and clips, selecting regions
to paste into the project.  Operations done in the viewer affect a
temporary EDL or a clip but not the timeline.

</p><li>Compositor

<p>This window displays the output of the timeline.  It's the interface
for most compositing operations or operations that affect the
appearance of the timeline output.  Operations done in the Compositor
affect the timeline but don't affect clips.

</p><li>Program

<p>This contains the timeline and the entry point for all menu driven
operations.  The timeline consists of a vertical stack of tracks with
horizontal representation of time.  This defines the output of
rendering operations and what is saved when you save files.

</p><li>Resources

<p>Effects, transitions, clips, and assets are accessed here.  Most of the
resources are inserted into the project by dragging them out of the
resource window.  Management of resource allocation is also performed
here.

</ul>

<p>Under the <em>Window</em> menu you'll find options affecting the main
windows.  <em>default positions</em> repositions all the windows to a 4
screen editing configuration.  On dual headed displays, the
<em>default positions</em> operation fills only one monitor with windows.

<p>An additional window, the <em>levels window</em> can be brought up from
the <em>Window</em> menu.  The <em>levels</em> window displays the output
audio levels after all mixing is done.

<h2>LOADING FILES</h2>

<p>All data that you work with in Cinelerra is acquired either by
<em>recording from a device</em> or by <em>loading from disk</em>.  This
section describes loading.

<p>The loading and playing of files is just as you would expect. Just go
to <em>file-&gt;Load</em>, select a file for loading, and hit <em>ok</em>. Hit
the forward play button and it should start playing, regardless of
whether a progress bar has popped up.

<p>Another way to load files is to pass the filenames as arguments on the
command line.  This creates new tracks for every file and starts the
program with all the arguments loaded.

<p>If the file is a still image, the project's attributes are not changed
and the first frame of the track becomes the image.  If the file has
audio, Cinelerra may build an index file for it to speed up drawing. 
You can edit and play the file while the index file is being built.

Up:<a rel=up href="#LOADING%20FILES">LOADING FILES</a>
<br>

<h3>SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS</h3>

<p>The format of the file affects what Cinelerra does with it.  Some
formats replace all the project settings.  Some just insert data with
existing project settings.  If your project sample rate is 48khz and
you load a sound file with 96khz, you'll still be playing it at
48khz.   XML files, however, replace the project settings.  If you load
an XML file at 96khz and the current project sample rate is 48khz,
you'll change it to 96khz.  Supported file formats are currently:

<ul>
<li>WAV
<li>PCM
<li>AIFF
<li>Uncompresed Quicktime

<p>Quicktime is not the standard for UNIX but we use it because it's well
documented.  All of the Quicktime movies on the internet are
compressed.  Cinelerra doesn't support compressed Quicktime movies. 
Most of the Quicktime footage dealt with in Cinelerra is generated by
Cinelerra either recording from a device or rendering.  The best
Quicktime settings to use are JPEG video and twos audio.

</p><li>JPEG, PNG, TIFF, TGA sequences

<p>Cinelerra generates a special table of contents file when you render an
image sequence.  You can either select every image file to load or
select the table of contents when the rendering is done.  Selecting the
table of contents is faster and doesn't fill up the resource window
with thousands of images.

</p><li>JPEG, PNG, TIFF, TGA still images

<p>When loaded, the image takes up one frame in length and doesn't change
the project attributes.

</p><li>AVI with mp3 audio and MPEG-4 video

<li>MPEG 1, 2 video

<p>You need to run <em>mpeg3toc</em> to generate a table of contents for
these, then load the table of contents.  If you want to edit a DVD,
find the corresponding <em>ifo</em> file for the program of interest and run

<pre>mpeg3toc /cdrom/video_ts/vts_01_0.ifo dvd.toc
</pre>

<p>or something similar.  Then load <em>dvd.toc</em>.  This allows frame
accurate editing where none would be possible otherwise.

</p><li>MPEG program streams and transport streams

<p>You need to run <em>mpeg3toc</em> on these just like MPEG 1,2 video. 
Program and transport streams are structured into multiple tracks. 
Each track can be video or audio.  Each audio track can have 1-6
channels.  Cinelerra converts each channel of audio into a track, so
for MPEG streams with multiple tracks, the tracks will be flattened.

</p><li>MPEG audio layer II, III

<p>These can be loaded directly with no table of contents.  Variable
bitrate streams may need a table of contents but are playable without
it.

</p><li>AC3 audio

<li>XML

<p>These are generated by Cinelerra for storing edit lists.  They change
project attributes when loaded.

</ul>

<br>

<h3>INSERTION STRATEGY</h3>

<p>Usually three things happen when you load a file.  First the existing
project is cleared from the screen, second the project's attributes are
changed to match the file's, and finally the new file's tracks are
created in the timeline.

<p>But Cinelerra lets you change what happens when you load a file.

<p>In the file selection box go to the <em>Insertion strategy</em> box and
select it.  Each of these options loads the file a different way.

<ul>

<li>Replace current project

<p>All tracks in the current project are deleted and new tracks are
created to match the source.  Project attributes are only changed when
loading XML.  If multiple files are selected it adds new tracks for
every file.

</p><li>Replace current project and concatenate tracks

<p>Same as replace current project except if multiple files are selected
it concatenates the tracks of every file after the first.

</p><li>Append in new tracks

<p>The current project is not deleted and new tracks are created for the
source.

</p><li>Concatenate to existing tracks

<p>The current project is not deleted and new files are concatenated to
the existing tracks.

</p><li>Paste at insertion point

<p>The file is pasted in like a normal paste operation.

</p><li>Create new resources only

<p>The timeline is unchanged and new resources are created in the Resource
Window.

</ul>

<p>The insertion strategy is a recurring option in many of Cinelerra's
functions.  In each place the options do the same thing.  With these
options you can almost do all your editing by loading files.

<p>If you load files by passing command line arguments to Cinelerra, the
files are loaded with <em>Replace current project</em> rules.

<br>

<h3>LOADING MULTIPLE FILES</h3>

<p>In the file selection box go to the list of files.  Select a file.  Go
to another file and select it while holding down <em>CTRL</em>.  This
selects one additional file.  Go to another file and select it while
holding down <em>SHIFT</em>.  This selects every intervening file.  This
behavior is available in most every list box.

<p>Select a bunch of mp3 files and <em>Replace current project and
concatenate tracks</em> in the insertion strategy to create a song
playlist.

<br>

<h2>LOADING THE BACKUP</h2>

<p>There is one special XML file on disk at all times.  After every
editing operation Cinelerra saves the current project to a backup in
<em>$HOME/.bcast/backup.xml</em>.  In the event of a crash go to
<em>file-&gt;load backup</em> to load the backup.  It is important after a
crash to reboot Cinelerra without performing any editing operations. 
Loading the backup should be the first operation or you'll overwrite
the backup.

Up:<a rel=up href="#LOADING%20AND%20SAVING%20FILES">LOADING AND SAVING FILES</a>
<br>

<h2>SAVING FILES</h2>

<p>When Cinelerra saves a file it saves an edit decision list of the
current project but doesn't save any media.  Go to <em>File-&gt;save
as...</em>.  Select a file to overwrite or enter a new file.  Cinelerra
automatically concatenates <em>.xml</em> to the filename if no
<em>.xml</em> extension is given.

<p>The saved file contains all the project settings and locations of every
edit but instead of media it contains pointers to the original media
files on disk.

<p>For each media file the XML file stores either an absolute path or just
the relative path.  If the media is in the same directory as the XML
file a relative path is saved.  If it's in a different directory an
absolute path is saved.

<p>In order to move XML files around without breaking the media linkages
you either need to keep the media in the same directory as XML file
forever or save the XML file in a different directory than the media
and not move the media ever again.

<p>If you want to create an audio playlist and burn it on CD-ROM, save the
XML file in the same directory as the audio files and burn the entire
directory.  This keeps the media paths relative.

<p>XML files are useful for saving the current state before going to sleep
and saving audio playlists but they're limited in that they're specific
to Cinelerra.  You can't play XML files in a dedicated movie player. 
Realtime effects in an XML file have to be resynthesized every time you
play it back.  The XML file also requires you to maintain copies of all
the source assets on hard drives, which can take up space and cost a
lot of electricity to spin.  For a more persistent storage of the
output there's rendering.

<br>

<h2>RENDERING FILES</h2>

<p>Rendering takes a section of the timeline, performs all the editing,
effects and compositing, and stores it in a pure movie file.  You can
then delete all the source assets, play the rendered file in a movie
player, or bring it back into Cinelerra for more editing.  It's very
difficult to retouch any editing decisions in the pure movie file,
however, so keep the original assets and XML file around several days
after you render it.

<p>To begin a render operation you need to define a region of the timeline
to render.  The navigation section describes methods of defining
regions.  See <a href="#NAVIGATING%20THE%20PROJECT">NAVIGATING THE PROJECT</a>.  When a region is highlighted
or in/out points are set, the affected region is rendered.  When no
region is highlighted, everything after the insertion point is
rendered.

<p>Go to <em>File-&gt;render</em> to bring up the render dialog.  Select the
magnifying glass to bring up a file selection dialog.  This determines
the filename to write the rendered file to.

<p>In the render dialog select a format from the <em>File Format</em> menu. 
The format of the file determines whether you can render audio or video
or both.  Select <em>Render audio tracks</em> to generate audio tracks
and <em>Render video tracks</em> to generate video tracks.  Select the
wrench next to each toggle to set compression parameters.  If the file
format can't store audio or video the compression parameters will be
blank.  If <em>Render audio tracks</em> or <em>Render video tracks</em> is
selected and the file format doesn't support it, trying to render will
pop up an error.

<p>The <em>Create new file at each label</em> option causes a new file to be
created when every label in the timeline is encountered.  This is
useful for dividing long audio recordings into individual tracks.  When
using the renderfarm, <em>Create new file at each label</em> causes one
renderfarm job to be created at every label instead of using the
internal load balancing algorithm to space jobs.

<p>When <em>Create new file at each label</em> is selected, a new filename
is created for every output file.  If the filename given in the render
dialog has a 2 digit number in it, the 2 digit number is overwritten
with a different incremental number for every output file.  If no 2
digit number is given, Cinelerra automatically concatenates a number to
the end of the given filename for every output file.

<p>In the filename <em>/hmov/track01.wav</em> the <em>01</em> would be
overwritten for every output file.  The filename
<em>/hmov/track.wav</em>; however, would become <em>/hmov/track.wav001</em>
and so on and so forth.  Filename regeneration is only used when either
renderfarm mode is active or creating new files for every label is
active.

<p>Finally the render dialog lets you select an insertion mode.  The
insertion modes are the same as with loading files.  In this case if
you select <em>insert nothing</em> the file will be written out to disk
without changing the current project.  For other insertion strategies
be sure to prepare the timeline to have the output inserted at the
right position before the rendering operation is finished. 
See <a href="#EDITING">EDITING</a>.  Editing describes how to cause output to be inserted
at the right position.

<p>It should be noted that even if you only have audio or only have video
rendered, a <em>paste</em> insertion strategy will behave like a normal
paste operation, erasing any selected region of the timeline and
pasting just the data that was rendered.  If you render only audio and
have some video tracks armed, the video tracks will get truncated while
the audio output is pasted into the audio tracks.

<h1>NAVIGATING THE PROJECT</h1>

<p>The thing you want to do most of the time is get to a certain time and
place in the media.  Internally the media is organized into tracks. 
Each track extends across time.  Navigation involves both getting to a
track and getting to a certain time in the track.

<br>

<h2>NAVIGATING THE PROGRAM WINDOW</h2>

<p>The program window contains many features for navigation and displays
the timeline as it is structured in memory: tracks stacked vertically
and extending across time.  The horizontal scroll bar allows you to
scan across time.  The vertical scroll bar allows you to scan across
tracks.

<p>Below the timeline you'll find the zoom panel.  The zoom panel contains
values for <em>sample zoom</em>, <em>amplitude</em>, and <em>track
zoom</em>.  These values in addition to the scrollbars are all that's
needed to position the timeline.

<br><p>
<img src="zoompanel.png" alt="zoompanel.png">,

<p>Changing the <em>sample zoom</em> causes the amount of time visible to
change.  <em>If your mouse has a wheel and it works in X11 go over
the tumblers and use the wheel to zoom in and out.</em>

<p>The <em>amplitude</em> only affects audio.  It determines how big the
waveform is if the waveform is drawn.

<p>The <em>track zoom</em> affects all tracks.  It determines the height of
each track.  If you change the track zoom the amplitude zoom
compensates so  audio waveforms look proportional.

<p>In addition to the graphical tools, you'll probably more often use the
keyboard to navigate.  Use <em>PAGE UP</em> and <em>PAGE DOWN</em> to
scroll up and down the tracks.

<p>Use the <em>LEFT</em> and <em>RIGHT</em> arrows to move across time. 
You'll often need to scroll beyond the end of the timeline but
scrollbars won't let you do it.  Instead use the <em>RIGHT</em> arrow to
scroll past the end of timeline.

<p>Use the <em>UP</em> and <em>DOWN</em> arrows to change the sample zoom by a
power of 2.

<p><em>CTRL-UP</em> and <em>CTRL-DOWN</em> cause the amplitude zoom to change.

<p><em>CTRL-PGUP</em> and <em>CTRL-PGDOWN</em> cause the track zoom to change.

<h3>THE INSERTION POINT</h3>

<p>By default you'll see a flashing insertion point in the program window
the first time you boot it up.  This is where new media is pasted onto
the timeline.  It's also the starting point of all playback
operations.  When rendering it defines the region of the timeline to be
rendered.

<p>The insertion point is normally moved by clicking inside the timebar. 
Any region of the timebar not obscured by labels and in/out points is a
hotspot for repositioning the insertion point.

<br><p>
<img src="main_timebar.png" alt="main_timebar.png">,
<em>The main timebar</em>

<p>The insertion point also can be moved by clicking in the timeline
itself, but not always.  The insertion point has two modes of
operation:

<ul>
<li>drag and drop mode

<li>cut and paste mode

</ul>

<p>The mode of operation is determined by selecting the arrow or the
i-beam in the buttonbar.

<br><p>
<img src="editing_mode.png" alt="editing_mode.png">,
<em>The editing mode buttons</em>

<p>If the arrow is highlighted it enables <em>drag and drop</em> mode.  In
drag and drop mode, clicking in the timeline doesn't reposition the
insertion point.  Instead it selects an entire edit.  Dragging in the
timeline repositions the edit, snapping it to other edit boundaries. 
This is normally useful for reordering audio playlists and moving
effects around.

<p>If the i-beam is highlighted it enables <em>cut and paste mode</em>.  In
cut and paste mode clicking in the timeline repositions the insertion
point.  Dragging in the timeline highlights a region.  The highlighted
region becomes the playback range during the next playback operation,
the rendered range during the next render operation, and the region
affected by cut and paste operations.

<p><em>Shift-clicking</em> in the timeline extends the highlighted region.

<p><em>Double-clicking</em> in the timeline selects the entire edit the
cursor is over.

<p>It should be noted that when moving the insertion point and selecting
regions, the positions are either aligned to frames or aligned to
samples.  When editing video you'll want to align to frames.  When
editing audio you'll want to align to samples.  This is set in
<em>settings-&gt;align cursor on frames</em>.

<p>If the highlighted region is the region affected by cut and paste
operations, how do I cut and paste in <em>drag and drop</em> mode?  In
this case you need to set <em>in/out points</em> to define an affected region.

Up:<a rel=up href="#NAVIGATING%20THE%20PROGRAM%20WINDOW">NAVIGATING THE PROGRAM WINDOW</a>
<br>

<h3>THE IN/OUT POINTS</h3>

<p>In both editing modes you can set in/out points.  The in/out points
define the affected region.  In drag and drop mode they are the only
way to define an affected region.  In both cut and paste mode and drag
and drop mode they override the highlighted area.  If a highlighted
area and in/out points are set, the highlighted area affects playback
while the in/out points affect editing operations.  To avoid confusion
it's best to use either highlighting or in/out points but not both
simultaneously.

<p>To set in/out points go to the timebar and position the insertion point
somewhere.  Hit the <img src="in_point_button.png" alt="in_point_button.png"> <em>in point button</em>.  Go
to a position after the in point and hit the <img src="out_point_button.png" alt="out_point_button.png">
<em>out point button</em>.

<br><p>
<img src="inout_points.png" alt="inout_points.png"> <em>Timebar with in/out points set</em>.

<p>Select either the in point or the out point and the insertion point
jumps to that location.  After selecting an in point, if you hit the
<em>in point button</em> the in point will be deleted.  After selecting
an out point, if you hit the <em>out point button</em> the out point will
be deleted.

<p>If you select a region somewhere else while in/out points already
exist, the existing points will be repositioned when you hit the in/out
buttons.

<p><em>Shift-clicking</em> on an in/out point extends the highlighted region
to that point.

<p>Instead of using the button bar you can use the <em>[</em> and <em>]</em>
keys to toggle in/out points.

<p>The insertion point and the in/out points allow you to define an
affected region but they don't let you jump to exact points on the
timeline very easily.  For this purpose there are labels.

Up:<a rel=up href="#NAVIGATING%20THE%20PROGRAM%20WINDOW">NAVIGATING THE PROGRAM WINDOW</a>
<br>

<h3>USING LABELS IN THE PROGRAM WINDOW</h3>

<p>Labels are an easy way to set exact locations on the timeline you want
to jump to.  When you position the insertion point somewhere and hit
the <img src="label_button.png" alt="label_button.png"> <em>label button</em> a new label appears on the
timeline.

<br><p>
<img src="timebar_label.png" alt="timebar_label.png"> <em>Timebar with a label on it</em>

<p>No matter what the zoom settings are, clicking on the label positions
the insertion point exactly where you set it.  Hitting the label button
again when a label is selected deletes it.

<p><em>Shift-clicking</em> on a label extends the highlighted region.

<p><em>Double-clicking</em> between two labels highlights the region between
the labels.

<p>Hitting the <em>l</em> key has the same effect as the label button.

<p>If you hit the label button when a region is highlighted, two labels
are toggled at each end of the highlighted region.  If one end already
has a label, then the existing label is deleted and a label is created
at the opposite end.

<p>Labels can reposition the insertion point when they are selected but
they can also be traversed with the <img src="label_traversal.png" alt="label_traversal.png"> <em>label
traversal</em> buttons.  When a label is out of view, the label traversal
buttons reposition the timeline so the label is visible.  There are
keyboard shortcuts for label traversal, too.

<p><em>CTRL-LEFT</em> repositions the insertion point on the previous label.

<p><em>CTRL-RIGHT</em> repositions the insertion point on the next label.

<p>With label traversal you can quickly seek back and forth on the
timeline but you can also select regions.

<p><em>SHIFT-CTRL-LEFT</em> extends the highlighted region to the previous
label.

<p><em>SHIFT-CTRL-RIGHT</em> extends the highlighted region to the next label.

<p>Manually hitting the label button or <em>l</em> key over and over again
to delete a series of labels can get tedious.  For deleting a set of
labels, first highlight a region and second use the <em>Edit-&gt;Clear
labels</em> function.  If in/out points exist, the labels between the
in/out points are cleared and the highlighted region ignored.

<h2>NAVIGATING THE VIEWER AND COMPOSITOR</h2>

<p>The navigation features of the Viewer and Compositor behave very
similarly.  Each has a timebar and slider below the video output.  The
timebar and slider are critical for navigation.

<br><p>
<img src="timebarslider.png" alt="timebarslider.png">,

<p>The timebar represents the entire time covered by the program.  When
you define labels and in/out points it defines those, too.  Finally the
timebar defines a region known as the <em>preview region</em>.

<p>The <em>preview region</em> is the region of the timeline which the
slider effects.  The slider only covers the time covered by the preview
region.  By using a preview region inside the entire program and using
the slider inside the preview region you can quickly and precisely seek
in the compositor and viewer.

<p>When you replace the current project with a file the preview region
automatically resizes to cover the entire file.  When you append data
or change the size of the current project, the preview region stays the
same size and shrinks.  Therefore, you need to resize the preview
region.

<p>Load a file and then slide around it using the compositor slider.  The
insertion point in the main window follows the compositor.  Move the
pointer over the compositor's timebar until it turns into a left resize
pointer.  The click and drag right.  The preview region should have
changed and the slider resized proportionally.

<p>Go to the right of the timebar until a right resize pointer appears. 
Drag left so the preview region shrinks.

<p>Go to the center of the preview region in the timebar and drag it
around to convince yourself if can be moved.

<br><p>
<img src="previewregion.png" alt="previewregion.png">,

<p><em>Preview region in compositor</em>

<p>If you go to the slider and slide it around with the preview region
shrunk, you'll see the slider only affects the preview region.  The
timebar and slider in the viewer window work exactly the same.

<p>Labels and in/out points are fully supported in the viewer and
compositor.  The only difference between the viewer and compositor is
the compositor reflects the state of the program while the viewer
reflects the state of a clip but not the program.

<p>When you hit the <em>label button</em> in the compositor, the label
appears both in the compositor timebar and the program timebar.

<p>When you select a label or in/out point in the compositor, the program
window jumps to that position.

<br><p>
<img src="viewer_labels.png" alt="viewer_labels.png"> <em>Labels and in/out points in the viewer</em>.

<p>In the viewer and compositor, labels and in/out points are displayed in
the timebar.  Instead of displaying just a region of the program, the
timebar displays the entire program here.

<h2>NAVIGATING THE RESOURCES</h2>

<p>The resource window is divided into two areas.  One area lists folders
and another area lists folder contents.  Going into the folder list and
clicking on a folder updates the contents area with the contents of
that folder.

<p>The folder and contents can be displayed as icons or text.

<p><em>Right clicking</em> in the folder or contents area brings up a menu
containing formatting options.  Select <em>Display text</em> to display a

<br>

<h2>USING THE TRANSPORT CONTROLS</h2>

<p>Transport controls are just as useful in navigation as they are in
playing back footage, hence they are described here.  Each of the
Viewer, Compositor, and Program windows has a transport panel.

<br><p>
<img src="transport_panel.png" alt="transport_panel.png"> <em>The transport panel</em>.

<p>The transport panel is controlled by the keyboard as well as the
graphical interface.  For each of the operations it performs, the
starting position is the position of the insertion point or slider. 
The ending position is either the end or start of the timeline or the
end or start of the selected region if there is one.

<p>The orientation of the end or start depends on the direction of
playback.  If it's forward the end position is the end of the selected
region.  If it's backward the end position is the start of the selected
region.

<p>The insertion point moves to track playback.  When playback stops it
leaves the insertion point where it stopped.  Thus, by playing back you
change the position of the insertion point.

<p>The keyboard interface is usually the fastest and has more speeds.  The
transport keys are arranged in a <em>T</em> on the number pad.

<ul>

<li><em>+</em> Fast reverse
<li><em>6</em> Normal reverse
<li><em>5</em> Slow reverse
<li><em>4</em> Frame reverse
<li><em>1</em> Frame forward
<li><em>2</em> Slow forward
<li><em>3</em> Normal forward
<li><em>Enter</em> Fast forward
<li><em>0</em> Stop
<li><em>Spacebar</em> Normal forward
</ul>

<p>Hitting any key on the keyboard twice pauses it.

<p>When using frame advance functions the behavior may seem odd.  If you
frame advance forward and then frame advance backward, the displayed
frame doesn't change.  This is because the playback position isn't the
frame but the time between two frames.  The rendered frame is the area
that the playback position crosses.  When you increment the time
between two frames by one and decrement it by one, you cross the same
frame both times and so the same frame is displayed.

<h1>EDITING</h1>

<p>Editing comprises both the time domain and the track domain.  Since the
timeline consists of a stack of tracks, you need to worry about how to
sort and create tracks in addition to what time certain media appears
on a track.

<p>In the time domain, Cinelerra offers many ways to approach the editing
process.  The three main methods are two screen editing, drag and drop
editing, and cut and paste editing.

<p>There are several concepts Cinelerra uses when editing which apply to
all the methods.  The timeline is where all editing decisions are
represented.  Every track on the timeline has a set of attributes on
the left, the most important of which is the <em>arm track</em>
attribute.

<br><p>
<img src="track_attributes.png" alt="track_attributes.png"><em>Track attributes</em>

<p>Only the <em>armed tracks</em> are affected by editing operations.  Make
sure you have enough armed destination tracks when you paste or splice
material or some tracks in the material will get left out.

<p>In addition to editing operations, the armed tracks in combination with
the active region determine where material is inserted when loading
files.  If the files are loaded with one of the insertion strategies
which doesn't delete the existing project, the armed tracks will be
used as destination tracks.

<p>The active region is the range of time in the edit decision on the
timeline.  The active region is determined first by the presence of
in/out points in the timeline.  If those don't exist the highlighted
region is used.  If no highlighted region exists the insertion point is
used as the active region and the active length is 0.

<p>Finally, editing decisions never affect source material.  Editing only affects
pointers to source material, so if you want to have a media file at the
end of your editing session which represents the editing decisions, you
need to <em>render</em> it. See <a href="#RENDERING%20FILES">RENDERING FILES</a>.

<br>

<h2>MANIPULATING TRACKS</h2>

<p>Tracks in Cinelerra either contain audio or video.  There is no special
designation for tracks other than the type of media they contain.  When
you create a new project, it contains a certain mumber of default
tracks.  You can still add or delete tracks from a number of menus. 
The <em>Tracks</em> menu contains a number of options for dealing with
multiple tracks simultaneously.  Each track itself has a popup menu
which affects one track.

<p>Bring up the popup menu by moving over a track and right clicking.  The
popup menu affects the track whether it's armed or not.

<p><em>Move up</em> and <em>move down</em> moves the one track up or down in
the stack.  <em>Delete track</em> deletes the track.

<p>Operations in the <em>Tracks</em> menu affect only tracks which are
armed.

<p><em>Move tracks up</em> and <em>Move tracks down</em> shift all the armed
tracks up or down the stack.

<p><em>Delete tracks</em> deletes the armed tracks.

<p><em>Delete last track</em> deletes the last track, whether it's armed or
not.  Holding down the <em>d</em> key quickly deletes all the tracks.

<p><em>Concatenate tracks</em> is more complicated.  It takes every
<em>playable</em> track and concatenates it to the end of the first
<em>armed tracks</em>.  If there are two armed tracks followed by two
playable tracks, the concatenate operation puts the two playable tracks
after the two armed tracks.  If there are three playable tracks
instead, two tracks are put after the armed tracks and a third track is
put on the end of the first armed track.  The destination track wraps
around until all the playable tracks are concatenated.

<p>Finally, you'll want to create new tracks.  The <em>Audio</em> and
<em>Video</em> menus each contain an option to add a track of their
specific type.  In the case of audio, the new track is put on the
bottom of the timeline and the output channel of the audio track is
incremented by one.  In the case of video, the new track is put on the
top of the timeline.  This way, video has a natural compositing order. 
New video tracks are overlayed on top of old tracks.

<h2>TWO SCREEN EDITING</h2>

<p>This is the fastest way to construct a program out of movie files.  The
idea consists of viewing a movie file in one window and viewing the
program in another window.  Sections of the movie file are defined in
one window and transferred to the end of the program in the other
window.

<p>The way to begin a two screen editing session is to load some
resources.  In <em>file-&gt;load</em> load some movies with the insertion
mode <em>create new resources</em>.  You want the timeline to stay
unchanged while new resources are brought in.  Go to the Resource
Window and select the <em>media</em> folder.  The newly loaded resources
should appear.  Drag a resource from the media side of the window over
the Viewer window.

<p>There should be enough armed tracks on the timeline to put the sections
of source material that you want.  If there aren't, create new tracks
or arm more tracks.

<p>In the viewer window seek to the starting point of a clip you want to
use.  Use either the <em>slider</em> or the <em>transport controls</em>. 
Use the <em>preview region</em> to narrow down the search.  Set the
starting point with the <img src="in_point_button.png" alt="in_point_button.png"> <em>in point button</em>.

<p>Seek to the ending point of the clip you want to use.  Set the ending
point with the <img src="out_point_button.png" alt="out_point_button.png"> <em>out point button</em>.  The
two points should now appear on the timebar and define a clip.

<p>There are several things you can do with the clip now.

<ul>

<li>
Splice <img src="splice_button.png" alt="splice_button.png"> inserts the clip in the timeline, pushing
everything back.  If an <em>in point</em> or <em>out point</em> exists on
the timeline it's inserted there, otherwise it's inserted after the
insertion point.  After that, the insertion point moves to the end of
the clip.  If there is no in/out point, the insertion point will be
used as the next splice location.  This way you can continuously build
up the program by splicing.

<li>
Overwrite <img src="overwrite_button.png" alt="overwrite_button.png"> overwrites the region of the
timeline with the clip.  If an <em>in point</em> or <em>out point</em>
exists on the timeline it's overwritten there, otherwise it's
overwritten after the insertion point.  If a region is highlighted or
both in and out points exist the difference between the active region
and the clip length is deleted.

<li>
Create a clip <img src="toclip_button.png" alt="toclip_button.png"> generates a new clip for the
resource window containing the affected region but doesn't change the
timeline.  Every clip has a title and a description.  These are
optional.

<li>
Cut and copy behave the same as in cut and paste editing.

<br>

<h2>DRAG AND DROP EDITING</h2>

<p>The answer is yes, you can you create a bunch of clips and drag them on
the timeline.  You can also drag edits around the timeline.

<p>Load some files using <em>file-&gt;load</em>.  Set the insertion mode to
<em>Create new resources</em>.  This loads the files into the Resource
Window.  Create some audio and video tracks on the timeline using the
video and audio menus.

<p>Open the <em>Media</em> folder in the resource window.  Drag a media file
from the resource window to the timeline.  If the media has video, drag
it onto a video track.  If the media is pure audio, drag it onto an
audio track.

<p>Cinelerra fills out the audio and video tracks below the dragging
cursor with data from the file.  This affects what tracks you should
create initially and which track to drag the media onto.  If the media
has one video track and two audio tracks, you'll need one video track
and two audio tracks on the timeline and the media should be dragged
over the first video track.  If the media has audio only you'll need
one audio track on the timeline for every audio track in the media and
the media should be dragged over the first audio track.

<p>When dragging, the media snaps to the start of track if the track is
empty.  If there are edits on the track, the media snaps to the nearest
edit boundary.

<p>You can also drag multiple files from the resource window.  Either draw
a box around the files, use SHIFT, or use CTRL when selecting files. 
When you drop the files in the timeline, they are concatenated.  The
behavior of SHIFT and CTRL changes depending on if the resources are in
text or icons.

<p>To display the resources as text or icons, right click inside the media
list.  Select either <em>display icons</em> or <em>display text</em> to
change the list format.

<p>When displaying text in the resource window <em>SHIFT-clicking</em> on
media files extends the number of highlighted selections. 
<em>CTRL-clicking</em> on media files in text mode selects additional
files one at a time.

<p>When displaying icons in the resource window <em>SHIFT-clicking</em> or
<em>CTRL-clicking</em> selects media files one at a time.

<p>In addition to dragging media files, if you create clips and open the
<em>clip</em> folder you can drag clips on the timeline.

<p>In the timeline there is further dragging functionality.  To enable the
dragging functionality of the timeline, select the arrow toggle
<img src="arrow.png" alt="arrow.png">.  Move over an edit and drag it.  If more than one
track is armed, Cinelerra will drag any edits which start on the same
position as the edit the cursur is currently over.  During a dragging
operation the edit snaps to the nearest boundary.

<p>Dragging edits around the timeline allows you to sort music playlists,
sort movie scenes, and give better NAB demos but not much else.

<br>

<h2>CUT AND PASTE EDITING</h2>

<p>This is the traditional method of editing in audio editors.  In the
case of Cinelerra, you either need to start a second copy of Cinelerra
and copy from one copy to the other, copy from different tracks in the
same copy, or load a media file into the Viewer and copy from there.

<p>Load some files onto the timeline.  To perform cut and paste editing
select the <img src="ibeam.png" alt="ibeam.png"> i-beam toggle.  Select a region of the
timeline and select the <img src="cut.png" alt="cut.png"> cut button to cut it.  Move the
insertion point to another point in the timeline and select the
<img src="paste.png" alt="paste.png"> paste button.  Assuming no in/out points are defined on
the timeline this performs a cut and paste operation.

<p>If in/out points are defined, the insertion point and highlighted
region are overridden by the in/out points for clipboard operations. 
Thus, with in/out points you can perform cut and paste in drag and drop
mode as well as cut and paste mode.

<p>If you open a second copy of Cinelerra, cutting and pasting can
transport media between the two copies.

<p>A final operation in cut and paste editing is the <em>edit-&gt;clear</em>
operation.  If a region is highlighted or in/out points exist, the
affected region is cleared by <em>edit-&gt;clear</em>.  But if the insertion
point is over an edit boundary and the edits on each side of the edit
boundary are the same resource, the edits are combined into one edit
comprised by the resource.  The start of this one edit is the start of
the first edit and the end of this one edit is the end of the second
edit.  This either results in the edit expanding or shrinking.

<br>

<h2>TRIMMING</h2>

<p>With some edits on the timeline it's possible to do trimming.  By
trimming you shrink or grow the edit boundaries by dragging them.  In
either drag and drop mode or cut and paste mode, move the cursor over
an edit boundary until it changes shape.  The cursor will either be an
expand left or an expand right.  If the cursor is an expand left, the
dragging operation affects the beginning of the edit.  If the cursor is
an expand right, the dragging operation affects the end of the edit.

<p>When you click on an edit boundary to start dragging, the mouse button
number determines which dragging behavior is going to be followed.  3
possible behaviors are bound to mouse buttons in the interface
preferences. See <a href="#INTERFACE">INTERFACE</a>.

<p>The effect of each drag operation not only depends on the behavior
button but whether the beginning or end of the edit is being dragged. 
When you release the mouse button, the trimming operation is performed.

<p>In a <em>Drag all following edits</em> operation, the beginning of the
edit either cuts data from the edit if you move it forward or pastes
new data from before the edit if you move it backward.  The end of the
edit pastes data into the edit if you move it forward or cuts data from
the end of the edit if you move it backward.  All the edits thereafter
shift.  Finally, if you drag the end of the edit past the start of the
edit, the edit is deleted.

<p>In a <em>Drag only one edit</em> operation, the behavior is the same when
you drag the beginning or end of an edit.  The only difference is none
of the other edits in the track shift.  Instead, anything adjacent to
the current edit expands or shrinks to fill gaps left by the drag
operation.

<p>In a <em>Drag source only</em> operation, nothing is cut or pasted.  If
you move the beginning or end of the edit forward, the source reference
in the edit shifts forward.  If you move the beginning or end of the
edit backward, the source reference shifts backward.  Where the edit
appears in the timeline remains the same but the source shifts.

<p>For all file formats besides still images, the extent of the trimming
operation is clamped to the source file length.  Attempting to drag the
start of the edit beyond the start of the source clamps it to the
source start.

<p>In all trimming operations, all edits which start on the same position
as the cursor when the drag operation begins are affected.  Unarm
tracks to prevent edits from getting affected.

<h1>USING EFFECTS</h1>

<p>It would be sufficient to perform all changes to the timeline using
editing operations, but this isn't very extensible.  Certain timeline
changes should produce a different effect in the output without
involving a unique procedure to apply each change.  This is why we have
effects.

<p>Effects fall into three categories, and each effect in a category is
applied the same way.

<br>

<h2>REALTIME EFFECTS</h2>

<p>These are layered under the track they apply to.  They process the
track when the track is played back, with no permanent storage of the
output except when the project is rendered.

<h2>RENDERED EFFECTS</h2>

<p>These are performed on a section of the track and the result stored
somewhere before they are played back.  The result is usually pasted
into the track to replace the original data.

<p>The rendered effects are not listed in the resource window but instead
are accessed in the <em>Audio-&gt;Render effect</em> and <em>Video-&gt;Render
effect</em> options.

<h2>TRANSITIONS</h2>

<p>When one edit ends and another edit begins, the default behaviour is to
have the first edit's output immediately become the output of the
second edit when played back.  Transitions are a way for the first
edit's output to become the second edit's output with different
variations.

<p>Cinelerra supports audio and video transitions, all of which are listed
in the resource window.

<h1>SETTING PROJECT ATTRIBUTES</h1>

<p>When you play media files in Cinelerra, the media files have a certain
number of tracks, a certain frame size, a certain sample size, and so
on and so forth.  No matter what the media file has; however, it is
still played back according to the project attributes.  If an audio
file's samplerate is different than the project attributes, it is
resampled.  If a video file's frame size is different than the project
attributes, it is composited on a black frame, either cropped or
bordered with black.
