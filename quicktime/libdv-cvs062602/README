This is LibDV, a GPL codec for DV video.  

See http://libdv.sourceforge.net/

LibDV now uses the GNU "Autotools" for building.  

BUILDING from CVS checkout
==========================

The CVS repository does not contain files generated by the autotools,
so you need to run the bootstrap script*:

  ./bootstrap

You can ignore the following error messages:

  automake: configure.in: installing `config/install-sh'
      error while copying

  automake: configure.in: installing `config/mkinstalldirs'
      error while copying

  automake: configure.in: installing `config/missing'
      error while copying


After that, you can do this to build the library and the example
player:

  ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
  make

The maintainer-mode is if you are on a system that has recent
autotools installed, and you wish to make changes to the build
scripts.

The makefile generated by the autotools is very large, so the more
useful targets don't jump out at you.  Here are a few.

Build a "tar.gz" distribution file:

  make dist 

Build a rpm package file.  This requires you run as root, or you
setup your ~/.rpmmacros to allow building rpms without root:

  make rpm 

Clean up objects and binaries:

  make clean 

Clean up including files generated by autotools, which should return
the working directory state to be like it as after a CVS checkout:

  make maintainer-clean 


* The autotools book (http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/) recommends
  "bootstrap" instead of autogen.sh.  


NTSC Setup/Pedestal
===================

The decoder's add_ntsc_setup option should only be used 
by North American NTSC users when viewing the video on your computer
monitor. It should never be used when transcoding, image processing,
or rendering.

The encoder's rem_ntsc_setup (rem=remove) should be used
only in the rare case that an image has had 7.5 IRE setup artificially
added. During post-production, accounting for setup should be avoided.
It is the responsibility of the analog output of your DV equipment to
add setup where appropriate. If your DV equipment lacks this option,
then use a processing amplifier.

These options--both for decoding
and encoding--are always ignored for PAL video.

Luma and Chroma Clamping
========================

ITU-R 601 specifies that the legal range for luma is 16-235 and 
for chroma is 16-240 regardless of NTSC, PAL, or setup issues. However,
some users take advantage of the footroom or headroom below or above
these ranges to encode additional information for things such as
luma keying. The luma and chroma clamp options permit the range checking
to be disabled to preserve the superblack and superwhite.
